## Profile Summary
- I am an experienced, driven, and entrepreneurial professional with extensive background in building and leading artificial-intelligence/machine-learning oragnizations. 
- Built [Fluent.ai inc.](https://www.fluent.ai){target=_blank} from zero into a well-known provider of on-device/offline speech recognition solutions.
    - Led the research and tech roadmap, patents and IP growth/acquisition plan, business as well as tech partnerships, and overall strategy of the company.
    - Led the development of tiny (â‰ˆ 40KB) deep learning models for speech recognition on low-power edge devices.
    - Filed, acquired, and licensed 15+ patents; several of which have been granted.
    - Built and grew partnerships with various chip manufacturers partners, such as, ARM, CEVA, DSPG, Ambiq, NXP, DSPC etc.
    - Contributed to sales and business development. Negotiated OEM/ODM deals.
    - Helped raise investments from angels and VCs over multiple rounds.
- PhD in speech and AI. 
- Active research in AI/machine learning, deep learning, tinyML.

## More details

I founded [Fluent.ai](http://www.fluent.ai){target=_blank} and grew it, in my role as Founder and CTO, from zero to a well-known provider of speech recognition systemss. At Fluent.ai, we developed cutting-edge machine learning techniques for offline, on-device voice user interfaces targetted at tinyML, low-power embedded devices, smart-home devices, and wearables. We used a unique end-to-end spoken language understanding system. Unlike conventional speech recognition systems [speech --> text --> intent], these models do not require the intermediate text step and are able able to directly go from speech to intent, much like humans. Please see [the website](http://www.fluent.ai){target=_blank} for more details.

My research interests are in the general area of artificial intelligence, particularly for speech and langauge understanding, but also beyond for vision, generative networks, reinforcement learning, etc. I completed my PhD from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, at McGill University, Montreal, Canada. I was associated with the speech and language research group supervised by [Dr. Richard Rose](https://research.google.com/pubs/104847.html){target=_blank} [now at Google].

Prior to joining McGill, I worked as a research fellow in the Dept. of Electrical Engineering at the [Indian Institute of Technology Bombay [IIT B]](http://www.iitb.ac.in){target=_blank}, Mumbai, India. I worked with the [Information Networks laboratory](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~infonet/){target=_blank}. I was primarily associated with the TTSL IIT Bombay Center of Excellence in Telecommunications [TICET], one of the six Telecom Centers Of Excellence [TCOE] set up by the Department of Telecommunications [DoT], Govt. of India.

I earned my B.Tech. in Information and Communication Technology [ICT] from [Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology [DA-IICT]](http://www.daiict.ac.in){target=_blank}, Gandhinagar, Gujarat, India in May 2008. During my stay at DA-IICT, I was affiliated with Communications and Signal Processing [CSP], NextGenWireless and Speech Communications research groups. I also served as the vice chair-person of IEEE student branch, DA-IICT for 2007-08.
