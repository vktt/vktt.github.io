    - Led the development of tiny (â‰ˆ 40KB) deep learning models for speech recognition on low-power edge devices.
    - Filed, acquired, and licensed 15+ patents; several of which have been granted.
    - Built and grew partnerships with various chip manufacturers partners, such as, ARM, CEVA, DSPG, Ambiq, NXP, DSPC etc.
    - Contributed to sales and business development. Negotiated OEM/ODM deals.
    - Helped raise investments from angels and VCs over multiple rounds.
- PhD in speech and AI.
- Active research in AI/machine learning, deep learning, tinyML.

## More details

Currently focused on building [Avsr AI](https://www.avsr.io){target=_blank}. At Avsr AI, we are creating an integrated framework for robotics that combines Generative AI for high-level planning with Reinforcement Learning for precise, low-level control. Our team has strong background in both AI and Robotics, and consists of experienced second-time entrepreneurs. With driving factors such as labor shortages, safety and increased efficiency, robotics and physical automation is potentially one of the most impactful opportunities in near future.

Previosuly, I founded [Fluent.ai](http://www.fluent.ai){target=_blank} and grew it, in my role as Founder and CTO, from zero to a well-known provider of speech recognition systemss. At Fluent.ai, we developed cutting-edge machine learning techniques for offline, on-device voice user interfaces targetted at tinyML, low-power embedded devices, smart-home devices, and wearables. We used a unique end-to-end spoken language understanding system. Unlike conventional speech recognition systems [speech --> text --> intent], these models do not require the intermediate text step and are able able to directly go from speech to intent, much like humans. 

My research interests are in the general area of artificial intelligence, language, robotics, generative networks, reinforcement learning, etc. I completed my PhD from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, at McGill University, Montreal, Canada. I was associated with the speech and language research group supervised by [Dr. Richard Rose](https://research.google.com/pubs/104847.html){target=_blank} [now at Google].

Prior to joining McGill, I worked as a research fellow in the Dept. of Electrical Engineering at the [Indian Institute of Technology Bombay [IIT B]](http://www.iitb.ac.in){target=_blank}, Mumbai, India. I was primarily associated with the TTSL IIT Bombay Center of Excellence in Telecommunications [TICET], one of the six Telecom Centers Of Excellence [TCOE] in India. I got my B.Tech. in Information and Communication Technology [ICT] from [Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology [DA-IICT]](http://www.daiict.ac.in){target=_blank}, Gandhinagar, Gujarat, India.
